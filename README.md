# CSC335 HW2

Programs used to solve homework 2 in CSC335 Numerical Methods.  
Textbook problems are named after their section and problem number. I.e `2.1.15.cpp` is the program that solves problem 15 in section 2.1.  
Problem 1 from Dr. Pounds is solved by `rootFinder.cpp`.  
All programs have an associated text file that is the output of a sample run. I.e. `2.1.15.txt` is the sample run of `2.1.15.cpp`.

## Build Instructions
